This Visual Studio Code extension provides interactive IDE features for verifying Rusti programs with the [Prusti verifier](https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev).

For advanced use cases, consider switching to the [command-line version of Prusti](https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev).

## Requirements

In order to use this extension, please install the following components:

* Java JDK version 11 or later, 64 bit. For example, [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/).
* [Rustup version 1.23.0 or later](https://rustup.rs/). On Windows, this in turn requires the [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

If anything fails, check the "Troubleshooting" section below. Note that macOS running on M1 is currently not supported by this extension.

## First Usage

1. Install the requirements (listed above) and restart the IDE.
   * This will ensure that programs like `rustup` are in the program path used by the IDE.
2. Install the ["Prusti Assistant"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=viper-admin.prusti-assistant) extension.
3. Open a Rust file to activate the extension.
   * At its first activation, this extension will automatically download Prusti and install the required Rust toolchain.
4. Click on the "Verify with Prusti" button in the status bar.
   * Alternativelly, you can run the `Prusti: verify the current crate or file` command.
   * If the program is in a folder with a `Cargo.toml` file, Prusti will verify the crate in which the file is contained.
   * If no `Cargo.toml` file can be found in a parent folder of the workspace, Prusti will verify the file as a standalone Rust program. No Cargo dependencies are allowed in this mode.
5. Follow the progress from the status bar.
   * You should see a "Verifying crate [folder name]" or "Verifying file [name]" message while Prusti is running.
6. The result of the verification is reported in the status bar and in the "Problems" tab.
   * You can open the "Problems" tab by clicking on Prusti's status bar.
   * Be aware that the "Problems" tab is shared by all extensions. If you are not sure which extension generated which error, try disabling other extensions. (Related VS Code issue: [#51103](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/51103).)

To update Prusti, run the command `Prusti: update verifier` in the command palette.

If anything fails, check the "Troubleshooting" section below.

## Features

### Commands

This extension provides the following commands:

* `Prusti: verify the current crate or file` to verify a Rust program. Clicking the "Verify with Prusti" button in the status bar runst this command.
* `Prusti: update verifier` to update Prusti.
* `Prusti: show version` to show the version of Prusti.
* `Prusti: restart Prusti server` to restart the Prusti server used by this extension.

### Configuration

The main configuration options used by this extension are the following:

* `prusti-assistant.verifyOnSave`: Specifies if programs should be verified on save.
* `prusti-assistant.verifyOnOpen`: Specifies if programs should be verified when opened.
* `prusti-assistant.prustiVersion`: Allows to choose between the latest Prusti release (the default), a fixed release specified as a GitHub tag, or a local build of Prusti.
* `prusti-assistant.checkForUpdates`: Specifies if Prusti should check for updates at startup.
* `prusti-assistant.javaHome`: Specifies the path of the Java home folder (leave empty to auto-detect).

### Inline Code Diagnostics

This extension automatically provides inline diagnostics for Prusti errors.

### Snippets

Basic code-completion snippets are provided for Prusti annotations.

## Verification cache

By default, Prusti transparently caches verification requests. To clear the cache, it's enough to restart the Prusti server with the commands described above.

## Troubleshooting

If Prusti fails to run, you can inspect Prusti's log from VS Code (View -> Output -> Prusti Assistant) and see if one of the following solutions applies to you.

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| On Windows, Visual Studio is installed but the `rustup` installer still complains that the Microsoft C++ build tools are missing. | When asked which workloads to install in Visual Studio make sure "C++ build tools" is selected and that the Windows 10 SDK and the English language pack components are included. If the problem persists, check [this Microsoft guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup) and [this Rust guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installing-rustup-on-windows). Then, restart the IDE. |
| The JVM is installed, but the extension cannot auto-detect it. | Open the settings of the IDE, search for "Prusti-assistant: Java Home" and manually set the path of the Java home folder. Alternatively, make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set in your OS. Then, restart the IDE. |
| Prusti crashes mentioning "Unexpected output of Z3" in the log. | Prusti is using an incompatible Z3 version. Make sure that the `Z3_EXE` environment variable is unset in your OS and in the settings of the extension. Then, restart the IDE. |
| `error[E0514]: found crate 'cfg_if' compiled by an incompatible version of rustc` | There is a conflict between Prusti and a previous Cargo compilation. Run `cargo clean` or manually delete the `target` folder. Then, rerun Prusti. |
| `error: the 'cargo' binary, normally provided by the 'cargo' component, is not applicable to the 'nightly-2021-09-20-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' toolchain` <br/> or <br/> `error[E0463]: can't find crate for std` <br/> or <br/> `error[E0463]: can't find crate for core` | The Rust toolchain installed by Rustup is probably corrupted (see issue [rustup/#2417](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/2417)). [Uninstall](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42322879/how-to-remove-rust-compiler-toolchains-with-rustup) the nightly toolchain mentioned in the error (or all installed nightly toolchains). Then, rerun Prusti. |
| `error: no override and no default toolchain set` | Rustup has probably been installed without the `default` toolchain. [Install it](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46864309/2491528), then rerun Prusti. |
| `libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` on Ubuntu 22.04 | Ubuntu 22.04 deprecated `libssl1.1` and moved to `libssl3`. Consider [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72366805/2491528) as a temporary workaround to install `libssl1.1`, or compile Prusti from source code to make it use `libssl3`. |
| On macOS running on an M1 chip, the extension doesn't work and the log contains messages such as `incompatible architecture (have (arm64), need (x86_64))`. | We currently don't release precompiled arm64 binaries for macOS. Until we do so, the only option is to [compile Prusti from source code](https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev). |
